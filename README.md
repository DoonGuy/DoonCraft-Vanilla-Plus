# DoonCraft Vanilla+

Summary
- A simple QOL and optimization modpack that works great for SMPs!

Description
- This is a simple fabric modpack that adds optimizations and quality of life enhancements to the vanilla game. It can be used to connect to vanilla servers or get a near vanilla experience in singleplayer. The mods chosen were what I found to achieve the best performance and make the game more enjoyable, while not adding anything to require changes server-side. Most features of OptiFine are available, along with my favourite resource packs and shaders to take advantage of those features.
